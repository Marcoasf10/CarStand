# Car Stand MVC Application

## Overview

The **Car Stand** is a car listing and management application built using **ASP.NET Core MVC**. 
The app allows users to view car listings and lets an admin perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. 

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core MVC**: Web framework for building the app.
- **Entity Framework Core**: ORM for interacting with the database.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database used for storing car data and user information.
- **Bootstrap**: Front-end framework for responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Allowing dynamic interactivity.
  
## Deployment

The **Car Stand MVC Application** has been deployed using **Railway** **free plan**, making it accessible on the web.

To deploy the app, I used **Docker** for containerization. Docker helps to package the application and its dependencies into a single container,
ensuring that it runs consistently across different environments. 
The application was configured with a `Dockerfile` to set up the necessary environment and dependencies, and was then deployed on Railway's platform.

The app used to be available at **https://carlosmassano.up.railway.app/** but unfortunately the free trial expired.
